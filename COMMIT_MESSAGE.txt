refactor: Remove S3 download logic from worker, simplify to thin client

Architectural change: Move all parsing and enrichment logic to asp-core.
asp-worker becomes a thin client responsible only for SQS message handling.

## Changes

- Remove S3 download service and configuration from worker
- Simplify IngestionQueueListener to only trigger processing in core
- Update HttpIngestionClient to call /internal/ingestions/{id}/process
- Remove S3 and PDFBox dependencies from build.gradle.kts
- Update documentation to reflect new architecture

## Removed

- S3ClientConfig.java (deleted)
- S3DownloadService.java (deleted)
- All S3-related environment variables from docs

## Modified

- IngestionQueueListener.java: Simplified to trigger processing only
- SqsPollingService.java: Removed S3 download references
- HttpIngestionClient.java: Updated to call processing endpoint
- application.yml: Removed S3-related comments
- build.gradle.kts: Removed S3 and PDFBox dependencies
- docs/01-project-setup.md: Updated environment variables

## Architecture

Worker now:
1. Receives SQS message
2. Fetches ingestion metadata (optional)
3. Triggers POST /internal/ingestions/{id}/process in asp-core
4. Deletes SQS message

All PDF processing, parsing, and enrichment happens in asp-core.

No breaking changes to SQS message format or worker API.
